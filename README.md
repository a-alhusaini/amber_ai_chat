# ai_chat

This demo amber project shows how you would connect to an external api using Amber. We connect to the Cohere API and prompt one of their models with a question and we get a response back.

## Setup

```
git clone (link to repo)
cd ai_chat
COHERE_API_KEY={your cohere api key} amber w
```

This will run the app on localhost:3000
